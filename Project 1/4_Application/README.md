## Applications
1. Remote keyless entry systems, now fairly commonplace devices, provide car owners with a degree of convenience, making the task of physically inserting a key unnecessary. 
2. With PKE, car owners have simply to pull the door handle while the key fob is on their person; no searching through pockets or purses, no button pressing necessary.
3. Bi-directional communication makes this possible. When the door handle is pulled (or some similar trigger is activated) the base unit located within the vehicle emits a short range, low frequency signal â€“ polling for a nearby key fob transponder.
