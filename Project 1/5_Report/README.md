# Remote Keyless Entry

# 1.About Remote Keyless Entry

## 1.1 Description
* Over 70% of the vehicles made today come with a remote keyless entry  system either standard or as an option. 
* RKE systems are also a high volume after-market accessory. Most remote keyless entry systems alarm the vehicle against theft and lock and unlock the doors and trunk. Some include remote start and car finder functions.
* These applications require good transmit-receive range and reliable transmission. Increased receiver sensitivity and high transmit power  directly impact range and reliability.
* Low price is an obvious requirement, as there are millions of these systems being installed.

## 1.2 Identifying features:
* Keyless entry systems are used to remotely lock, unlock and start your car's engine using RF signals.
* It contains command and for security, rolling codes. 
* The remote keyless system's receiver in the car captures the RF signal, extracts it and sends the data stream to the CPU. The CPU decodes it and sends commands to the command module.

## 1.3 State of art
* Here, The Main focus point  is to controlling the car remotely and also to  securing our car with a reliable Encryption System.
* Now the above  two features are combined and made into one product .
  i.e. RKE
* As the world PACE-FORWARD, our technology needs to catch up to the world.
